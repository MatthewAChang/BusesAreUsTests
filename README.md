# BusesAreUsTests

Buses Are Us is an Android App that I created as my final project for CPSC 210: Software Construction at UBC. The app’s purpose is to help users locate bus stops in their vicinity and to show the arrival times of buses. The app takes information directly from the Translink’s API and updates in real-time. The closest stop to the user is highlighted on the map and its location is displayed on the bottom of the screen. The user can also click on any of the stops to display the buses that stop at it and also display the bus routes on the map as different coloured lines.
